## Technologies

Developing with Clean Arquitecture, Domain Driven Design (DDD), SOLID and following the Test Driven Development (TDD). It also has 100% of test coverage.

I used Typescript, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Jest, Swagger, JWT, BCrypt, Validator and other development dependencies to make the project works properly.

## Future of the project

Although a lot of things on backend are already done, I'm still finishing some routes. After, I plan to deploy it on AWS and create a Front-end.
